# Data Structures and Algorithms with Python

This repository contains notes and examples related to data structures and algorithms implemented in Python. It includes explanations of key concepts, code examples, and best practices.

## Arrays

### What is an Array?
An array is a data structure that stores a collection of elements, each identified by at least one array index or key.

### Advantages of Arrays
- Constant-time access to elements using an index.
- Facilitates easy implementation of algorithms due to their simplicity and efficiency.

### Disadvantages of Arrays
- Fixed size, leading to memory wastage if not fully utilized.
- Inefficient insertions and deletions, requiring shifting of elements.

### Memory Management using Arrays
- In languages like C and C++, memory for arrays is allocated contiguously, meaning that elements are stored in adjacent memory locations.

## Python Basics

### Interpreted Language
Python is an interpreted language, which means that the code is not directly executed by the computer's processor. Instead, it is executed by an interpreter.

### Simplicity and Readability
Python is known for its simplicity and readability, with a clean and straightforward syntax that makes it easy to read and write.
